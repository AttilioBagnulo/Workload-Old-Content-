Use the criteria below to evaluate operating costs for each of the workloads being assessed.  These values are entered in the Workload Assessment Model provided as part of this documentation.  A value of one (1) indicates a weak fit for the cloud.  A value of five (5) indicates a strong fit for the cloud. 

 

If a workload experiences low or virtually no operating costs, then there won't be much benefit in moving it to the cloud.  However if a workload requires a large team to be supported, moving it to the cloud by leveraging a Refactor, Revise, Rebuild or Replace will provide cost reductions to the organization
