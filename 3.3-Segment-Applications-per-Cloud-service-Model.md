After having profiled applications, which will tell us whether an application is suitable for the cloud, we then need to determine which cloud service model is best suited for that workload (application).  We do this by Segmenting Applications per Cloud Service Model.  Our alternatives are Rehost (IaaS), Refactor/Revise (IaaS/PaaS), Rebuild (PaaS), or Replace (SaaS).  We want to know which alternative best suits each workload. 

 

For each of the alternatives, one or more factors will rule them out. Each alternative has a set of decision filters that narrow the migration options that should be considered further for the workloads (applications) under evaluation. 

 

The decision filters for each alternative are listed below. 

 

Rehost (IaaS): 

VM Image Assembly - Can the system administrator team assemble a VM image with a full application stack and configure hardware? 

3rd Party Software in VM - Can third-party software be run in a VM, and is it supported by the vendor? 

Fat Client Form Factor - Does the application have a fat-client form-factor? 

Modernization Required - Does the application require modernization? 

  

Rehost options can be ruled out when licensing compatibility for third-party software cannot be extended to a VM, or if the architecture doesn't fit (e.g., fat-client architecture). 

  

Refactor/Revise (IaaS/PaaS) 

Existing Source Code - Can the development team recompile and repackage the application from existing source code? 

Functional Change - Are the demands for this function or business requirements rapidly changing? 

Time-to-Market - Is the application required with an extremely short time-to-market deadline? 

  

Refactor is not an appropriate option, and can be ruled out when an application cannot easily be adopted to meet the provider's sandbox restrictions or when skills or infrastructure to rebuild existing code are unavailable (e.g., build scripts or dependencies cannot be located and fixed, or developers cannot be assigned the task).  

 

Revise should be ruled out if time to market is the overriding priority, project scope creep is an unacceptable risk, or the code base is no longer valuable to the organization. 

  

Rebuild (PaaS): 

Lock-in Unacceptability – unacceptable to use proprietary PaaS 

Small-vendor Aversion – vendor sourcing strategy rules out small vendors 

  

Rebuilding an application for a proprietary PaaS should be ruled out when code or framework lock-in is considered an unacceptably high risk, or if vendor sourcing strategy rules out smaller vendors.  

 

If rapid time-to-market for the application is paramount, rebuilding complex functionality for a new container is not a good choice. 

  

Replace (SaaS): 

Change-ready Business - the business users' willingness to modify their business processes 

Non-Trivial process integration - the anticipated level of customization or integration with on-premises systems required 

Data Semantics - the organization's attitude to data lock-in 

  

Replacing should be avoided if there is a need to customize the SaaS solution to integrate with systems in the organization. When SaaS solutions are not flexible in SaaS can lose its long-term value if the organization has little or no flexibility over the data model, semantics locations, sources, or security, or when data switching costs are exorbitant.  SaaS is ruled out if an organization is unwilling or able to change its business processes.
