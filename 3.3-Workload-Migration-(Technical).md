There is a complementary approach that is more tactical and technical and is focused more on requirements. As we mentioned, the top-down approach analyzes where an application should go; here we are asking where a particular workload can go, based on its pure technical requirements. 

 

Once workloads have been identified for migration and their target location, the next step is to perform some due diligence to migrate the server or set of servers to the cloud.  If you have determined that you will be migrating an entire data center The approach in this section can be used to migrate a data center to the cloud. 

 

The process is identical whether you want to do a datacenter relocation or relocating workloads to the cloud. In other words, the process, the tools, the technical aspects are the same whether you want to do datacenter relocation or migrating a workload to the cloud. 

The bottom-up approach can occur simultaneously to your top-down planning and is aimed at providing a view into the  eligibility, at a technical level, of an application to migrate. We typically can pull much of this information from a Configuration Management Database (CMDB).  Ideally, this is populated using automated discovery. Enterprises use this method to provide additional insight to the top-down approach. 

 

The planning and approach for physically migrating a workload to the cloud includes: 

Discovery: A comprehensive inventory of the current environment 

Assessment: A Cloud decision framework is agreed upon. An assessment of the data discovered is then performed, this could range from assessing the potential target platform, to assessment of the potential workloads to be modernized. 

Planning: Planning for modernizing/migrating servers and workloads to a new target state. 

Target Validation: Ensure target is ready for migration. 

Modernization / Migration: Actual modernization and migration of servers and workloads. 

Operationalization and Optimization: 

 

The type of requirements evaluated by the bottom-up assessment cover the application or service required: maximum memory, maximum number of processors (CPU cores), maximum operating system storage space, maximum data drives, network interface cards (NICs), IPv6, network load balancing, clustering, version of the operating system, version of the database (if required), domains supported, and third-party components or software packages, among others.

As part of the bottom-up planning, catalog the technical aspects of your applications, including its operating system type, version, number of processors required, memory required, storage space and number of drives needed, and so on.  

 

Knowing the size of an applicationâ€™s database, and its data types, will help inform a decision as to whether to use, for example, a cloud-centric relational database such as Microsoft Azure SQL Database, Microsoft SQL Server, or Oracle in a virtual machine (VM), or perhaps even a NoSQL database. 

 

Existing integration systems will be affected by cloud migrations, at least temporarily.  Spend time documenting the potential impact on these systems. A clear understanding of which applications connect to which is required; is there an order of precedence for integration operations; how much data is moved and how frequently; and what is the architecture of your Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) tools? The complexity of your integration operations should be an important factor in prioritizing cloud migration goals. 

 

Business continuity and disaster recovery options are available, including failover to alternate datacenters, redundant data storage, and online backup. Consider how these options and capabilities map to the needs of the applications under analysis.
