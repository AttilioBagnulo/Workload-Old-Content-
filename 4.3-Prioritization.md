Merge content from here to Business Assessment/Portfolio - create a new subsection in Workload Migration 

Having defined the Cloud Strategy with adoption goals and resulting outcomes, we combine this information with a view of the business initiatives, to formulate a roadmap that will prioritize which workloads to move first. Business initiatives are supported by workloads. 

 

The table above links Cloud adoption goals mapped to specific migration strategies and cloud compute models.  This can be used as a guide as workloads are initially reviewed and triaged.

To determine which workloads are the right workloads to migrate to the Cloud and in which order, we make an initial triage with a high-level assessment using a Modernization Assessment Tool.  The assessment collects information on the cloud business drivers and the technical architecture of the workload and generates an automatic report, which brings clarity to the migration roadmap by identifying which workloads should be moved first.

The diagram above, shows Application or Business value (strategic value) on the y-axis and complexity of migration on the x-axis. The size of the bubbles demonstrate the benefits of modernizing and migrating the workload.  

 

Quick win: applications that do not involve too much complexity of migration, but deliver high strategic value. 

High impact: applications have high strategic value, high complexity, but will also reap benefits from modernization and migration.

The overlay above indicates how workloads are categorized initially.  Once we understand whether the workload is destined for cloud, we can also identify the type of Cloud compute model best fits that workload. 

 

The modernization assessment also provides this view.

The assessment provides recommendations regarding the type of migration that needs to occur.  Choices here include: 
 

Rehost (IaaS) - if the legacy app provides good value, but runs on outdated and expensive to support infrastructure, it may be a candidate for rehosting (also known as lift and shift); use P2V or V2V migration capabilities to move these;  

Refactor (IaaS) - similar to rehost, but on a different scale 

Rearchitect (PaaS) - modifying the application and replacing the underlying architecture 

Rebuild (PaaS) - recompiling in the cloud; similar to lift and shift, but some work involved 

Replace (SaaS) - workload provides some value, but it’s not part of your core competency or there exists a common off-the shelf (COTS) equivalent that can be used and that will reduce the technical debt you are incurring from having to maintain that app; replacing with COTS also provides an opportunity to see if there is an opportunity to consolidate and even to retire more applications as a result

Proven Practices:

Business requirements: having a good understanding of the organization's business environment keeping in mind any regulatory or compliance constraints that are relevant to a workload. If possible, make sure that the organization is committed to providing resources who understand their business environment sufficiently to work closely with the delivery resources to properly triage and do the initial categorization.

Redesign versus lift and shift: A large percentage of migration engagements fail, as organizations focus purely on the existing Solution and often ignore the potential return on investment (ROI) stemming from facilitating the full potential benefits of the Cloud platform. It is important to assess recommended migration approaches as opposed to lifting and shifting the existing application to the cloud platform.
