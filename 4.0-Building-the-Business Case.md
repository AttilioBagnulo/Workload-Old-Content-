Overview 

 

For a cloud migration initiative to succeed, there needs to be a clear business benefit of moving to the cloud. The business case needs to take into account the total cost of migrating the application to the cloud as well as the benefits received from having migrated.  A business case should include quantifiable and qualitative benefits as well as the total costs associated with migrating and operating the workload in the cloud. 

 

Develop a business case that takes into account your business goals and objectives,  business scenarios, risks, costs, & benefits of moving your applications to a modern platform. Evaluate the business ROI & learn more about modernization options and impacts. 

 

Quantifiable benefits: also called hard benefits show savings such as IT cost reductions, operating efficiency improvements, risk mitigation, increased revenue and increases in net promoter scores® (NPS®)3. Examples of quantifiable benefits reported by organizations, include, but are not limited to: 

 

General 

data center reduction of 50% to 73%, leading to cost savings of $12 million (includes electricity costs) 

annual reduction between 33% and 83% in IT outsourcing needs, leading to $9.8 million in cost savings 

re-engineering that delivers an 85% improvement for a key process, leading to $2.8 million in cost savings 

website scale and performance improvements, increasing annual customer sales between 48% and 63% and increasing transaction size between 20% and 27%, adding up to $1.2 million in new income. 

development and application testing environments in the cloud where they can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned as needed 

operating in the cloud frees the organization of the mundane tasks of system backup, network maintenance, patches, and software upgrades (in the case of SaaS) because the cloud provider handles these chores 

vast amounts of data that can be backed up to the cloud inexpensively --> need data around this 

Public Sector 

Improved citizen access to services (x% reduction in calls to call center) 

Commercial 

new sales leading to $1.7 million in new income from improved processes, global reach, and better customer service 

Increase in net promoter scores (NPS) 

 

Qualitative benefits: are soft benefits that are not easily quantified. Examples of these include, but are not limited to: 

moving the business more quickly in new directions (agility) 

ability to experiment with new and (otherwise) cost-prohibitive technologies (supports business innovation) 

developer and tester process improvements 

ability to reskill the organization,  

focus on other growth areas,  

increased morale,  

increased collaboration 

Improved citizen sentiment towards governments services 

cloud data centers take advantage of local, renewable energy (hydroelectric, wind) 

because of the cloud’s ability to run multiple copies of applications in different datacenters, redundancy and business continuity/disaster recovery (BC/DR) operations are greatly simplified

According to Gartner and organizations using cloud services today, the average cost savings achieved from using the cloud is 16%1. 

 

Cost Attributes 

 

Ongoing costs to operate an application in the Cloud - resource costs (servers, storage, networking), peak loads 

License management - autoscaling of infrastructure impacts, licensing rules 

Security management - software required to ensure adherence to regulations 

Service management - operationalizing the move to cloud; internal management and liaison is required 

Application rewrite, re-platforming, rebuilding costs of moving to the cloud 

Data and application integration 

Application deployment and testing 

Application maintenance and administration 

Adoption and change management - retraining as required 

 

Benefit Attributes 

 

Move from CapEx to OpEx 

Better capacity planning and Hardware Cost Avoidance - pre-designed, pre-approved configurations to quickly provision hardware for specific lease periods and then returned to the resource pool when no longer needed.  In a production environment, resources can be provisioned to accommodate temporary application peaks and returned to the resource pool when demand returns to normal. 

Contract-based Cloud services - lease expiries and ability to cancel as required 

Staff reassignment - automation provides the ability to reassign, retrain, reskill staff for growth in other areas 

Service levels - most organizations don't have service levels in place; Cloud provides service levels 

Application availability 

Application performance 

Application security 

Agility:  

Long deployment cycles increases time to market and reduced revenue attainment 

Ability to automate application provisioning decreases the time required to deploy applications and updates making new services features available more quickly with higher revenue opportunities 

Reduced technical debt - ability to refresh or replatform applications more quickly 

Key metric: Faster Service Deployment - reduction in average time taken to deploy a new service 

Scalability and elasticity: ability to scale infrastructure rapidly during demand spikes provides increased revenue potential; ability to support bursts 

Key metric: Application Provisioning Cost Avoidance - reduction in setup time, reduction in installation time, reductions in rework 

Operational Resilience 

Flexibility 

Modernization 

Productivity:  

Automation delivers reduction in time, effort, and errors associated with provisioning of servers, patches, configuration updates, discovery, audits, change management, reporting and compliance monitoring 

Self-service capabilities with a comprehensive catalog and associated workflows ensures that hardware and software deployments are standardized across the organization reducing time associated with service request management. 

 

Business Impacts 

 

Public Sector 

Greater opportunities to improve government-to-business (G2B) and citizen web channels with a solution that is more mobile and reliable, and meets scale and seasonality needs. 

Improved operating efficiencies 

Reduced data center, IT resource, and outsourcing costs 

Citizen satisfaction - improved responsiveness, increased availability and stability 

Time to market improvements - faster availability of new services 

Increased customer acquisition - competitive differentiation  

Commercial 

Greater revenue opportunities for business-to-business (GBB) and customer web channels with a solution that is more mobile and reliable, and meets scale and seasonality needs. 

Increased profits from greater revenue opportunities  

Improved production efficiencies 

Reduced data center, IT resource, and outsourcing costs 

Customer satisfaction - improved responsiveness, increased availability and stability 

Time to market improvements - faster availability of new features 

Increased customer acquisition - competitive differentiation  

General 

TTM 

Etc… 

 

Proven Practices 

Nominal savings are achieved from replicating a data center in the cloud 

Use cloud to achieve higher utilization - more efficiently run your infrastructure 

Come to cloud for hard savings; stay for the value of agility and the ability to easily address technical debt

3Net Promoter Score® (NPS): is a management tool that can be used to gauge the loyalty of organizations' customer/citizen relationships. It serves as an alternative to traditional customer satisfaction research and claims to be correlated with revenue growth. NPS has been widely adopted with more than two thirds of Fortune 1000 companies using the metric - From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter>
