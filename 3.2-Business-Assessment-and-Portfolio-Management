You're here because you want to : 

Do an initial triage of your workloads (profile applications) 

Identify workloads that should move to the cloud (segment applications) 

Identify which cloud service models best benefit specific workloads (prioritize alternatives) 

Prioritize the migration of those workloads (prioritize applications) 

 

The workload assessment model for this top-down approach is accessible here:  

<<Workload Assessment Example.xlsx>>
 

There is some sample data in the model to provide samples of workloads that have been assessed and the types of inputs that would apply.
