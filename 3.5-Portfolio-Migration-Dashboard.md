Rehost: 

VM Image Assembly - Can the system administrator team assemble a VM image with a full application stack and configure hardware? 

3rd Party Software in VM - Can third-party software be run in a VM, and is it supported by the vendor? 

Fat Client Form Factor - Does the application have a fat-client form-factor? 

Modernization Required - Does the application require modernization? 

  

Rehost options can be ruled out when licensing compatibility for third-party software cannot be extended to a VM, or if the architecture doesn't fit (e.g., fat-client architecture). 

  

Refactor/Revise 

Existing Source Code - Can the development team recompile and repackage the application from existing source code? 

Functional Change - Are the demands for this function or business requirements rapidly changing? 

Time-to-Market - Is the application required with an extremely short time-to-market deadline? 

  

Refactor is not an appropriate option and can be r led o t hen an application cannot easily be adopted to Refactor is not an appropriate option, and can be ruled out when an application cannot easily be adopted to meet provider's sandbox restrictions) or when skills or infrastructure to rebuild existing code are unavailable (e.g., build scripts or dependencies cannot be located and fixed, or developers cannot be assigned the task). Revise should be ruled out if time to market is the overriding priority, project scope creep is an unacceptable risk, or the code base is no longer valuable to the organization. 

  

Rebuild: 

Lock-in Unacceptability – unacceptable to use proprietary PaaS 

Small-vendor Aversion – vendor sourcing strategy rules out small vendors 

  

Rebuilding an application for a proprietary PaaS should be ruled out when code or framework lock-in is considered an unacceptably high risk, or if vendor sourcing strategy rules out smaller vendors.  

If rapid time-to-market for the application is paramount, rebuilding complex functionality for a new container is not a good choice. 

  

Replace: 

Change-ready Business - the business users' willingness to modify their business processes 

Non-Trivial process integration - the anticipated level of customization or integration with on-premises systems required 

Data Semantics - the organization's attitude to data lock-in 

  

SaaS is best avoided when the organization is unsure about the level of integration and customization to the core feature set they will require. Enterprises sometimes overlook crucial configuration and ecosystem requirements which limit theAPIs and partner solutions used for integration work SaaS can lose its long-term requirements, which limit the APIs and partner solutions used for integration work. SaaS can lose its long term value if the organization has little or no flexibility over the data model, semantics, locations, sources, or security, or when data switching costs are exorbitant. Some SaaS vendors will charge enterprises for extracting data from their services. SaaS is also ruled out if the company is not willing or able to modify its business processes.
