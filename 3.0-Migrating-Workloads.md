How exactly do we prioritize the migration of applications to the cloud? To understand what applications you should move, when, and how, it’s important to create a well-attributed catalog of applications managed by 

IT. Then, the relative importance of each attribute (say, business criticality or amount of system integration) can be weighted and you can build the prioritized list. 

 

The following criteria can be used to determine if an application or workload is ready for the cloud: 

 

Leveraging elasticity 

Leveraging scalability 

Complexity of the application (what is actually understood about the application) 

Impact to the business (benefits of a successful migration and risks of a failed migration) 

Transactional dependencies (integrations) 

Sensitive data 

 

Scope 

The Scope and Goals phase is the first phase of the Workload Assessment engagement and it contains the following two activities 

 

Define Scope and Approach: focusing on a certain portion of the application portfolio and a certain set of target migrations; this requires an initial review and categorization of the portfolio 

Review industry trends and identify migration objectives and outcomes (should be part of your Cloud Strategy)

The diagram above lists the top ten (10) reason organizations migrate workloads to the cloud. 

 

Leverage workload assessment for migration to ensure that each application migrated is assigned to cloud service models:1  

 

Rehost (IaaS)- redeploy the application to a different hardware environment and change the applications infrastructure configuration; lift and shift to the Cloud - move code and data (P2V2C, V2C); virtualization and re-platforming 

Refactor/Revise (IaaS or PaaS) - make code and configuration changes to connect the application to new infrastructure services; partial rewriting to move the application and improve it to run in the Cloud 

Rebuild/Rewrite - rearchitect and rebuild the application on a provider's application platform 

Replace (PaaS or SaaS) - Discard an existing application (or set of applications) and use commercial software delivered as a service to satisfy business requirements (SaaS) or build Cloud native app 

Retire - Application end of life; no use; not leveraged by significant portion of the business 

Retain - Leave application as is; perhaps move to the end-state data center; no move to the Cloud 

 

In assessing applications for movement to the cloud, we focus on the top four (4) categories - Rehost, Refactor/Revise, Rebuild/Rewrite, and Replace. 

 

Good candidates for migration include: 

 

Applications built in the last 10 years 

Use more contemporary technology 

Loosely coupled applications 

Lower security requirements 

Lower compliance issues - how data is audited, maintained and stored on public cloud 

Well documented and understood by IT 

Applications that run infrequently but require a significant or unpredictable amount of resources when they run 

Business-to-consumer (B2C) or Peer-to-peer (P2P, P2B) applications where the number of users accessing the application is unpredictable and elasticity of resources is required 

Applications used by mobile workers 

Applications that run in a different time zone from where IT is located 

Development and testing of applications 

Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) applications 

Applications built to use and provide APIs 

Applications that require rapid provisioning of infrastructure 

Applications that require a recurring capital expense (recurring operating expense would be preferable) 

Experimental workloads 

 

Bad candidates for migration include: 

 

More than 10 years old - e.g. old mainframe-based systems 

High security requirements: Security issues that can't be mitigated to an acceptable level of risk 

High number of compliance issues such as data federation 

Enabling technology for the application is archaic with no way to run that application in a public or private cloud 

Coupled (hard-wired) to the database (stored procedures and triggers) 

Not well understood by IT - person who understands the app is no longer available; costly to move to the cloud; deprioritized
