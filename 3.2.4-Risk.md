Use the criteria below to evaluate risks associated with migrating a workload to the cloud.  These values are entered in the Workload Assessment Model provided as part of this documentation.  A value of one (1) indicates a weak fit for the cloud.  A value of five (5) indicates a strong fit for the cloud.

Organizational Preparedness 

The complexity of migrating a workload to the cloud increases when an organization is unaware or unprepared to undertake this work. How prepared is the organization unit with Cloud management?  This criteria contributes to Ease of migration. 

 

Determine the value and record it in the workload assessment tool: 

Org… 

Org unit is unprepared 

 

 

 

 

<how do we want to present these> 

 

Organizational Unit is unaware and unprepared 

Org 

 

 

 

 

This contributes to ease of migration. 

 

Business Criticality 

Business critical workloads tend to be large, complex and heavily integrated with many various data sources.  These workloads should be prioritized last for migration to the cloud.  In many cases, these are very old workloads, which would not be a good fit for the cloud.

Technical Risk 

There is increased risk in migrating workloads that use old, legacy software and licenses. 

 

Resource Skill 

Complexity of migrating to the cloud increases when the organization does not have trained staff.  The staff needs to have knowledge of the application (workload) that will be migrated and needs to understand how this workload can be migrated and later operationalized in the cloud.
