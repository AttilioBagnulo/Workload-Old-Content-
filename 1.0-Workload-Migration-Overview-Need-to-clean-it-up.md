If you want to just migrate a data center to the cloud, then go straight to the technical migration 


If you want to prioritize workloads and determine which applications should move first, then do a business assessment and portfolio analysis to determine the prioritization 


Guide on how to use this documentation 


Introduction 


It can be daunting when a large enterprise IT department manages hundreds or thousands of applications running on perhaps tens of thousands of virtual machines (VMs). Which ones to move first? How to prioritize? How does operating in the cloud affect regulatory compliance, data security, and enterprise processes? What does it mean for organizational roles, training, and change management? And, last but certainly not least, how to do all this while continuing to serve the business? 


An organization doesn't just wake up one day and decide to migrate workloads to the cloud. There must be a compelling reason to use cloud: what business value will be derived by using public cloud services? This vision and goal then drives what applications should be in the cloud and which should not. This vision and goal should also drive the prioritization of migrating workloads to the cloud. 


Where to begin? 


Addressing the foundational and operational components without having a workload or set of workloads that will exist on the platform is of little value.  Identification, prioritization and migration of a workload is essential to the business case for change and ensures organizations prioritize the foundations and operational workstreams.  


 


Some organizations are very large and their IT department has to manage hundreds or thousands of applications running on several thousand virtual machines (VMs). Many are overwhelmed by the thought of workload migration.  For some, it's difficult to know where to start.  They need to determine: 


 

how moving to the cloud allows the organization to meet its goals and business outcomes 


the complexity and business value of migrating workloads 


how to prioritize the workloads and which ones to move first 


which cloud computing model to use (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS) 


the regulatory and compliance implications of moving workloads to the cloud 


the impact on data security and the current enterprise processes 


which roles, training, additional skills are required to operate the workloads in a Cloud environment 


the approach to adoption and change management - ensuring that investments in the Cloud will provide value to the organization

Before migrating to the cloud, there is a need to understand: 

Existing workloads 


Data 


Security requirements 


Compliance requirements 


How all of the above will migrate into the cloud 



 


For organizations, knowing how to efficiently handle application migration to the cloud is critical. In this section of Azure Acceleration, we consider two (2) aspects when migrating workloads to the Cloud.   


 


Cloud Adoption and Migration Approach Top-down (Business) Emphasis on modernizing applications 1. Where should the application live? Paas? laaS? SaaS? 2. Are there network or workload dependencies? Strategic / evaluative Bottom-up (Technical) Opportunistic Emphasis on environment rationalization 2. 3. Understand hardware inventory and network topology Are there workload dependencies? Adhere to business compliance requirements Tactical / cost-effective Evolve applications to Cloud 1. Migrate applications in the course of other projects 2. Convenience and efficiency On-the-fly / flexible 


 


It can be useful to think about application characteristics, or attributes, from two perspectives: the business (“top-down”) and technical (“bottom-up”) approaches. 


 


Business Aspect (Strategic and evaluative, Top-down) – focuses on business modernization initiatives and identifies how a workload will be transformed and the business value of transforming. Here, we use a strategic and evaluative approach for initially triaging workloads to understand: 

Cost benefit analysis of moving to the cloud 


Targeted outcomes  


Risks 


Where workloads should live 



 


 Technical Aspect (Tactical, Bottom-up) - uses a bottom up approach to workload migration to the cloud by understanding: 

hardware and software inventory 


workload dependencies 


business compliance requirements 


Where workloads can live 



 


Without a business benefit for moving to the cloud, cloud computing will fail.  Before embarking on the road to cloud computing, there needs to be a clear understanding of the outcomes that migrating a workload to the Cloud will bring to the organization.

The diagram above outlines the process for an overall portfolio assessment.  The portfolio assessment process is used: 


 

To deliver a top-down strategic and evaluative assessment of workloads, which determines an initial migration strategy and ultimate cloud computing model 


To deliver a bottom-up, deep, technical evaluation of the workloads with their hardware, software inventory, service dependencies, sizing, availability, business continuity, and operational requirements. 


As input to prioritize the migration of workloads and build an overall migration roadmap or program of change. 



 


The top-down approach asks where each application or workload should go; the bottom-up approach describes where each can go.

Prerequisites to Workload Migration 


 


Migrating workloads to the cloud requires that some elements be in place.  Some of these include: 


 

A cloud strategy has been developed and is in place where cloud adoption objectives and outcomes have been clearly documented 


Foundational elements in place: 

Identity 


Networking  



Operational - documenting how workloads will be supported operationally, building the team that will manage them 


Migration tools - these are required to discover workloads, track their status, convert workloads from one form to another (e.g. P2V, V2V, V2C, or even P2V2C), and for monitoring their performance
