Your organization likely runs hundreds—maybe thousands—of applications across a range of servers. You need an inventory mechanism that can feed data into subsequent steps. 

Using cloud migration assessment tools, compile an inventory of the physical and virtual servers in your environment. This data can include profile information and performance metrics about your applications. At the end of this step, you’ll have a complete inventory of servers with metadata for each, allowing you to build your cloud migration plan. 

Map on-premises applications 

Using information from your discovery, map your servers to represent your on-premises applications. This will help you identify dependencies or communication between servers so you can include all necessary application components in your cloud migration plan—to help reduce risks and ensure a smooth migration. Group your servers logically to represent the applications, and then select the best migration strategy for each application based on its requirements and migration objectives.

There is a complementary approach that is more tactical and technical and is focused more on the technical 

requirements. As we mentioned, the top-down approach analyzes where an application should go based on strategic cloud objectives; 

here we are asking where a particular workload can go, based on its pure technical requirements. 

The bottom-up approach occurs simultaneously to your top-down planning and is aimed 

at providing a view into the eligibility, at a technical level, of an application to migrate. We typically 

can pull much of this information from a Configuration Management Database (CMDB). Enterprises 

use this method to provide additional insight to the top-down approach. 

 

Catalog and rationalize your server, application, and services landscape with cloud-based dashboards & automation of application classification to minimize impact to IT staff. 

 

The type of requirements evaluated by the bottom-up assessment cover the application or service 

required: maximum memory, maximum number of processors (CPU cores), maximum operating 

system storage space, maximum data drives, network interface cards (NICs), IPv6, network load 

balancing, clustering, version of the operating system, version of the database (if required), domains 

supported, and third-party components or software packages, among others. 

 

To achieve this, a combination of people, process and technology are required.  Automated discovery will feed a configuration management process and the information gathered can be leveraged by an application portfolio management process that will allow an organization to identify attributes of an application such as: 

 

# of Users of the application or service 

Criticality of the application or service 

Age of the application 

Infrastructure on which it is hosted (servers, storage, networking, data centers) 

Age of infrastructure 

Location of the infrastructure 

Amount of system integration: Who the application talks to 

Technologies in use - Java, .Net, HTML, etc… 

Is source code available? 

# of IT staff supporting the application 

# of releases in the past X years 

Cost of managing the application 

Value to the organization - how does this application/service allow the organization to meet its goals? 

 

 

The very first step is Discovery. Discovery includes: 

 

Identifying target locations 

Data Collection 

Deploying discovery software on infrastructure  

Scanning environment to collect data on applications and related infrastructure (including interconnections) 

Reviewing gathered data and correlating with organizational information - perhaps through an existing application portfolio management system 

Creation of an application/service catalog, that can be used to rationalize and categorize by type 

Categorize by application type 

Complete preliminary server and application analysis 

A large number of tools that can help you assess the current state of your applications exist. As 

mentioned, a portfolio management system will be of great utility in listing and attributing your 

applications. The Microsoft System Center suite includes a CMDB as well as a host of monitoring and 

health management capabilities that will help you to ascertain the state of your systems. The 

Microsoft Assessment and Planning Toolkit is a solution accelerator that provides a large feature set 

for assessing existing IT environments. MAP facilitates the automated inventory and assessment of 

applications to determine basic suitability and VM sizing requirements. You also can use a number 

of third-party applications and utilities to perform similar functions.  

 

The type of information you collect with these instruments will address objective factors concerning 

hardware/VM eligibility and application/workload eligibility for cloud migration. These tools are useful 

for automated metadata collection about your applications and operating system instances. 

Scope: 

 

Inventory server systems to capture: 

Hardware configurations 

Installed application packages 

Published Web Site 

SQL server databases 

Create a catalog hosted in a CRM system (e.g. Microsoft Dynamics 365) 

Define up to five (5) business systems as a start 

Identify applications by type 

Filter applications in catalog to identify business applications that need to be moved to a modern platform by identifying noise such as: 

System Driver packages 

Hotfixes or service packages 

Agents or admin consoles 

System management utilities 

Antivirus or backup components
